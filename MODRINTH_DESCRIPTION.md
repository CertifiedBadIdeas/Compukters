# Compukters

**Program computers in Minecraft with Kotlin through an integrated in-game IDE.**

Compukters is an in-game programming platform built around Kotlin projects, programmable computers, persistent
storage, redstone automation, and a deterministic resource-bounded virtual machine.

> **Compukters is experimental and under active development.**
>
> The complete programming loop works, but Guest Kotlin, its APIs, and the player-facing experience continue to
> evolve. Breaking changes may occur between releases.

## Write Kotlin in the integrated IDE

Create persistent multi-file projects without leaving Minecraft. The client-side IDE provides:

- syntax highlighting, diagnostics, completion, hover information, and parameter information;
- declaration navigation, Kotlin-aware formatting, smart typing, and editor history;
- a project explorer, remembered workspaces, and versioned Compukters platform configuration;
- attachment to a computer with verified build, deploy, and run actions;
- read-only previews and imports from the attached computer's filesystem;
- an attached terminal for interacting with the target computer directly.

Code analysis and compilation run in isolated Kotlin K2 workers using the same Guest API definitions as the target
computer.

## Run programs on real computers

Every computer boots into an interactive shell and owns an isolated persistent `/home` filesystem. Programs and files
survive chunk unloads and world restarts. For quick edits, the computer also includes compact terminal tools:

```text
edit hello.kt
kotlinc hello.kt
hello
```

Guest programs can launch bounded cooperative tasks, communicate through `IntChannel`, start other programs, wait for
terminal input, and produce computer sounds.

## Automate with redstone

Programs can read and control all six sides of a computer relative to its facing. The Guest Kotlin API supports:

- immediate redstone input reads;
- efficient waits for the next change, an exact level, or a minimum level;
- output levels from `0` to `15`;
- persistent weak and direct power modes.

## Integrate with Create on Minecraft 1.21.1

With Create 6.0.x installed, Guest Kotlin projects can enable the optional `create` addon. Programs can read
adjacent speedometers and stressometers, suspend until their values change, and control an adjacent Rotation Speed
Controller. The IDE exposes this API only when the attached server supports it, and Compukters remains usable without
Create.

## Kotlin, without unrestricted JVM access

Compukters uses the Kotlin K2 frontend, but Guest programs do not run as Kotlin/JVM and cannot access arbitrary Java
classes, Minecraft internals, the server filesystem, or the host operating system:

```text
Kotlin source
    ↓
Kotlin K2 / IR
    ↓
verified Compukter bytecode
    ↓
managed runtime
```

The runtime controls memory, execution quotas, scheduling, and every capability exposed to programs. Guest Kotlin is
a deliberately bounded subset of the language and standard library; consult the support matrix for exact details.

## Compatibility

- **Minecraft 1.21.1** — NeoForge 21.1.250 or newer, Java 21
- **Minecraft 26.1.2** — NeoForge 26.1.2.97 or newer, Java 25
- **Operating systems:** Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64

Each Minecraft version has its own download. No Architectury runtime dependency is required.
