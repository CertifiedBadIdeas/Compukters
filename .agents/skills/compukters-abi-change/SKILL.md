# Compukters ABI Change

Make every producer, consumer, verifier, version decision, and ownership rule agree across tooling, JVM, and Rust
boundaries.

## Identify the Boundary

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, then locate the current source of truth and every reader before editing. Classify the
change as one or more of:

- canonical platform bundle encoding, module metadata, graph, identity, or compatibility rules;
- compiler or analysis worker framing, messages, payload manifest, identity, or limits;
- canonical `.cpkt` encoding, manifest, type, instruction, or debug metadata;
- artifact validation and Rust admission verification;
- Guest capability identity, operation schema, or value representation;
- exported Rust C ABI and Kotlin JDK 25 FFM layout or call contract;
- persisted VM state or another externally durable binary contract.

Decide explicitly whether the change is compatible, requires a version bump, or intentionally makes a clean break.
Treat a public ABI, artifact compatibility, or component-boundary change as architecture-significant work governed by
the repository roadmap rules.

When Guest Kotlin semantics drive the change, use `compukters-language-feature` to define the source-level contract and
this skill for its versioned representation. For VM or host-runtime implementation behind an unchanged versioned
boundary, use `compukters-runtime-change` instead.

## Change Both Sides Coherently

Update the smallest complete set of producers and consumers. Depending on the boundary, inspect:

- `guest-platform`, `platform-bundle`, and `platform-k2` producers and consumers;
- `worker-client`, `compiler-client`, `ide-analysis-client`, and `tooling-runtime` protocol and payload code;
- `compiler-artifact` models, validators, encoders, and generated conformance artifacts;
- K2 lowering and platform metadata that emit the affected structure;
- `host/compukter-vm` decoding, verification, execution, FFI exports, and test encoders;
- `native-runtime` FFM descriptors, layouts, adapters, ownership, and error mapping;
- loader-independent `core` contracts and Minecraft adapters only when behavior crosses into them.

Preserve the architectural ownership rules: Kotlin compiler internals stay on the trusted JVM side, Rust re-verifies
complete artifacts, native buffers remain caller-owned, and Rust pointers do not escape into Kotlin.

The VM is a Git submodule. If it changes, verify and commit its repository coherently, then update the parent gitlink
in a separate parent-repository commit without absorbing unrelated submodule work.

## Verify the Contract

Cover valid round trips and malformed rejection at the changed boundary. Check byte order, widths, signedness,
alignment, tags, counts, limits, ownership, and error mapping where applicable. Run focused producer-consumer and
wrong-version tests for platform bundles or worker protocols. Run focused JVM and Rust tests plus the relevant
cross-language conformance task when the boundary reaches the VM. Crossing repositories or runtime layers does not
automatically require `verifyLocalFull`; reserve it for release preparation or an explicit user request, following
`AGENTS.md`. Update active ABI or architecture documentation in the same stage.
Use the matching versioned-boundary row in `docs/VERIFICATION.md` so every claim has focused producer-consumer evidence
and the appropriate release gate.
