**Programmable computers for Minecraft with deterministic, resource-bounded Kotlin execution.**

Compukters is an in-game programming platform built around Kotlin `.kt`
projects, a pinned Kotlin K2/IR compiler pipeline, versioned Compukter bytecode,
and a managed Rust VM. The intended product loop runs from an in-game IDE to a
shell and programs executing on a computer inside Minecraft.

## Status

The compiler, canonical artifact, JDK 25 FFM session, managed Rust VM, standalone
playground, loader-independent `ProgramRuntimeHost`, and server computer block
form an executable vertical slice. A computer starts the source-visible no-std
`system/programs/boot.kt` from `/rom/boot`; boot launches `/rom/shell`, and the
shell can run verified extensionless programs in the foreground through
`Process.run`. The ordinary `/rom/kotlinc` program compiles one `.kt` source
from `/home` into an extensionless executable, using a server-global persistent
cache and an isolated K2 child process without blocking the server tick.
NeoForge GameTests cover registration, automatic boot, two computers compiling
and executing the same source, nested program execution, reboot, ticking,
removal, VM shutdown, and recovery of a tombstoned persistent filesystem.

The primary game baseline is **Minecraft 26.1.2**, **NeoForge 26.1.2.97**, and
**JDK 25**. A compatibility build targets **Minecraft 1.21.1**, **NeoForge
21.1.250**, and **Java 21** through the JNI runtime. The 26.1.2 production
archive uses Minecraft's official names directly; the 1.21.1 archive is remapped
during packaging. Neither archive requires Architectury at runtime.

language, standard-library, Guest API, and IDE compatibility boundaries.

## Minecraft development

Run Gradle with JDK 25 selected through `JAVA_HOME` or a Gradle-discoverable
installation:

```bash
./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel :v26_1-neoforge:runClient
./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel :v26_1-neoforge:runGameTestServer
./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel :v26_1-neoforge:buildProductionUniversalJar
./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel :v1_21_1-neoforge:runClient
./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel :v1_21_1-neoforge:buildProductionUniversalJar
```

Minecraft-independent Gradle modules are grouped beneath `modules/common`, while
all game-facing code is grouped beneath `modules/minecraft`. Minecraft and
NeoForge code shared across supported versions has one canonical source tree
under `modules/minecraft/shared`. IntelliJ indexes that tree against
the target selected by `compuktersActiveMinecraftVersion` in `gradle.properties`;
change the property to `1.21.1` or `26.1.2` and reload the Gradle project when
switching the version being edited. Inactive targets use generated mirrors, so
ordinary Gradle verification continues to compile both versions from the same
canonical content.

For fast feedback, `./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel verifyLocalFast` runs policy,
build-script, and a curated JVM test slice. Before treating the current checkout
as fully verified, run `./gradlew-sandbox-dev-parallel verifyLocalFull`; it covers
every Gradle subproject check, all registered Kotlin-to-VM conformance scenarios, Rust and FFM checks, runtime
integrations, the real GameTest server, and the
production artifacts for the locally configured native platform.

A distributable multi-platform release has a stricter, separate gate:
running `buildReleaseUniversalJar` from the repository root selects both
version-specific tasks. It requires a clean exact-tag checkout and the pinned
Linux and Windows Runtime bundles, then assembles and verifies both the 26.1.2
FFM and 1.21.1 JNI artifacts. A successful local full verification does not by
itself establish release readiness.

## Runtime boundary

`host/compukter-vm` is the pinned
[Compukter VM](https://github.com/CertifiedBadIdeas/Compukter-VM) submodule.
Kotlin compiler internals remain on the trusted JVM side; immutable verified
Compukter artifacts cross into the Rust runtime, which owns execution, quotas,
managed memory, scheduling, snapshots, and future optimization tiers.

The Rust runtime also owns each computer's filesystem. Minecraft persists only
a stable `ComputerId`; the immutable packaged `/rom` and isolated persistent
`/home` are mounted inside Rust. World data is rooted at
`<world>/compukters/filesystems`, flushed on saves and shutdown, and moved to a
recoverable tombstone when a player destroys the corresponding computer. Guest
code currently has bounded read-only `FileSystem.stat` and `FileSystem.list`
operations. Compilation is requested by the Rust machine from an immutable
source snapshot. The JVM service compiles or retrieves a verified artifact from
`<world>/compukters/compiler-cache`, then Rust re-verifies and atomically
installs it into the requesting computer's `/home`.

Inside a computer, compile and run a program with:

```text
kotlinc hello.kt
hello
```

Without `-o`, the output name is the source filename without `.kt`. An explicit
extensionless output is also supported:

```text
kotlinc hello.kt -o app
app
```

The current in-game compiler accepts exactly one source file per invocation.
Compiler failures leave an existing output untouched and are reported back in
the shell.

See [the current architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Standalone playground

The playground exercises the same isolated compiler, artifact verifier, FFM
adapter, Rust VM, and terminal capability that the mod will use. Run the
included multi-file example from the repository root:

```bash
./gradlew :playground:run --args examples/hello
```

It prompts on stdout, reads one UTF-8 line from stdin, and executes the emitted
Compukter bytecode. To retain the verified compiler output for inspection:

```bash
./gradlew :playground:run --args="examples/hello --emit build/hello.cpkt"
```

Compilation diagnostics and runtime failures go to stderr. Add `--debug` to
show launcher stack traces. The process uses stable exit categories: `2` usage,
`3` project input, `4` compilation, `5` compiler platform, `6` artifact
verification, `7` VM admission/start, `8` guest trap, `9` VM fault, `10` host
failure or EOF, `11` quota, `12` allocation resource failure, and `13` launcher
or native platform failure.
